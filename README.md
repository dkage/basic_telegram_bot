# Basic Telegram Bot

This is a bot that simply echoes whatever is sent to it, to be used as a start point to new bots.

In order for the bot to work, you first need to ask for a API_KEY from the @BotFather using Telegram's chat. After that it is neccessary to create a new ".py" file in the same folder as "basic_bot.py", that should be called "api_key.py", containing just a variable called "TOKEN" which should hold the api string.

    # api_key.py
    TOKEN = "apikey_string"
